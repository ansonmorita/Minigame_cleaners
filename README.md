## About design

### What we have
1. **Brightly colored** visual design was chosen to meet the aesthetic preferences of children.
2. All models in game are **Low-poly 3D**, low hardware requirements.
3. **Fairy-tale style story** design is more suitable for children (_story mode has not been added in the current version_). Players will play the role of a **cleaner** who cleans up germs inside a human's body and make themselves healthy by cleaning up more germs. Help the player to be inspired before/in the treatment and gain courage to fight the disease. At the same time, the player can get the feeling of working together with the medical staff to fight the disease, making the player more willing to accept treatment.
4. In-game control is **simple**, the viewpoint movement **is not related to** the character movement, even if the players can not turn their head or make big movements while playing, they can also play this game.
5. (Personal reasons) no VR device, currently only on the PC for testing. The input manager of unity is used to facilitate subsequent modifications.

### What in future
1. **Player character and enemy avatar** design and application
2. Game **sound** effects
3. **Settings** menu
4. In-game UI **beautification**
5. **More levels**
